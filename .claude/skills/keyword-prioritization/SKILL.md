# Keyword prioritization

Turn a raw list of keyword ideas into a ranked shortlist worth writing.

## Input

`content/keyword-ideas.csv` (from `content-gap-analysis`, or a list the user pastes in).

## Bottom of the funnel first

The default B2B mistake is ranking everything by search volume. Volume is sorted the same
way in every tool, so everyone chases the same high-volume generic terms. Instead, start at
the bottom of the funnel and work up. A smaller, high-intent topic that reaches a buyer who
is close to choosing is worth more than a big top-of-funnel term that reaches nobody who buys.

Boost keywords carrying **commercial-intent modifiers**: solution, platform, software, tool,
vendor, "best", "vs", alternative, comparison, pricing, and pain-point "how to" queries that
map to what the offer solves. Down-weight broad definitional terms.

## Optional input: what converts in paid

If the user runs Google Ads, ask whether they can share which keywords convert there (or
export it). What a company pays for and converts on is a strong signal for which organic
topics are worth winning. Use it to lift those topics in the ranking.

## How to score

For each keyword, rate 1 to 5 on:

1. **Intent and funnel stage:** how close is this searcher to a buying decision? Bottom-of-
   funnel and high-intent pain points score highest; generic top-of-funnel scores low even
   at high volume. This is the heaviest factor.
2. **Blog fit:** does it match the topics in `your-setup/brand-and-voice.md`? Off-topic
   keywords score low no matter how big.
3. **Product relevance:** can it lead naturally to something in `your-setup/your-offer.md`?
4. **Winnability:** can this user realistically rank or be cited for it? Use difficulty
   and SERP type if available, otherwise judge from how entrenched the current results are.

Weight intent and funnel stage most heavily. Compute a total. Be honest: discard keywords
that do not fit the user, even popular ones. A focused library beats a scattered one.

## Output

Update `content/keyword-ideas.csv` with the four scores and a total, sorted highest first.
Add a short note on the top 3 to 5 and why they lead. Suggest the user run
`/blog-pipeline "keyword"` on the top one.
